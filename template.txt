Start your document like this.

If I want to add an image, it would go like this:
![title of image](name_of_attached_image_file.jpg)

If I want to add a link to another site, [I could make one like
this](http://somewhere.com)

For full syntax documentation you can see the [Markdown syntax
document](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

There are plenty of good markdown editors to help you see what your outputted
document will look like. I like [Mou](http://mouapp.com/), but I'm sure there
are plenty of others for whatever your prefered platform may be.
